    key_challenges: ["Our first key challenge as a team was designing user flows and the frontend with a 'desktop-first' approach for facilitating donations to impactful charity projects without a precise design or business model reference.", "While we worked with a basic UI kit in Figma and some wire-frames in the first team project, now each team member was asked to start with one high fidelity prototype for his main page in Figma. Initially, this felt like unneccesarily doubling the efforts, but after struggling to code my second page without a high fidelity prototype, me and my team were reassured it actually saves time. With a Figma prototype for my third side, my team and I could easily split the work on individual components, streamlining development",  "After the final pitch and the end of the bootcamp we continued to work on the app to make it responsive. This process taught us efficient strategies and reinforced why it's essential to consider responsiveness from the start.", "Having learned about Websockets and ActionCable during the final project, I implemented real-time notifications about new reports or comments on the user's discusssions for the final pitch. An additional challenge was to go beyond the lecture content and implement the functionality on Heroku with Redis Cloud."],
